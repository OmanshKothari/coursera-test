<!-- defaut box size is extra [border width + padding] as the width we set for box is actually the width of the CONTENT_BOX by default --> 

<!-- Just like default content-box there are also default MARGINS AND PADDINGS -->

<!-- Cumulative margin: When there are elements with margin right and margin right side by side eah other they get add up.

Margin Collapse : When the elements are on top of each other the bigger of the margin among the two is kept and the other one COLLAPSES -->

<!-- none value did not override the deafult browser margin -->

<!-- OVERFLOW -when the box size is not large enough the extra content might OVERFLOW will span outside of the box.

"overflow" Property of elements can be used to deal with these situation

1. You can chose to clip[do not show] those content by using 
	overflow: hidden; 
2. You can chose to automatically add a scroll bar so that the user can scroll through the content with the content still inside the box.
	overfow: auto;
3. You can chose to add the scrollbar manually too.
	overflow: scroll;-->
